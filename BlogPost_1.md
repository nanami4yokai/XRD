# BlogPost 1 - Week 1 - Topic intro

This semester gave us the wonderful opportunity to choose to learn the exciting world of virtuality, to a further extent than how we did it up until now. Besides getting introduced to the topic of XR and going through the different aspects and variations of it, we also got the important details about the course and the way it will flow. 
But for the first blogpost, let’s cover some questions: 


-- What is VR/AR/AV/MR and the difference between them?

VR -  a fully immersive digital experience that isolates you from the real world.

AR - overlays digital content onto the real world without blocking your view.

AV - integrates real-world elements into a primarily virtual environment.

MR - blends digital and physical worlds, allowing them to interact in real-time.

	
The differences between them is the level of immersion into the digital world they provide, thus VR being able to fully detach you from the real world, while the rest provide different integrations of the 2 worlds (real and digital) into each other.


-- What is XR?

XR is an umbrella term that encompasses all these technologies—VR, AR, MR, and sometimes AV. It refers to any form of combined real and virtual environment that enhances the user's experience.


-- Key factors of XR

Amongst the lot of aspects that cover XR, like continuum of reality, real-time feedback, device integration and interaction, there are 2 that could be considered foundational to creating impactful XR experiences.
Immersion: The extent to which users feel surrounded by and part of the virtual environment. The deeper the immersion, the more convincing the experience feels, whether it's VR, AR, or MR.
Presence: The feeling of "being there" in a virtual or mixed world. High presence makes users believe they are in the virtual space by significantly enhancing the user's emotional and psychological connection to the experience, interacting with it as if it's real.


-- What aspects of life can XR integrate into and what benefits could it bring?

During the class we learned that XR can integrate into a vast majority of aspects of our life:
Gaming (of course) - don’t even get me started on the topic;
Art and culture - virtual galleries, interactive museum exhibits;
Retail and e-commerce - shopping experiences brought to a new level, with interactive product demos and trying on products using AR;
Architecture and constructions- virtual walkthrough of buildings and enhanced productivity tools;
Education and training - a hands-on experience in any domain imaginable; just think about how much healthcare training has increased, from investigating the human body hiding from the church, to using virtual images while doing biology classes homework;
Healthcare - training in the domain and practicing different scenarios like surgeries, as well as a form of treatment in mental health therapy; 


-- In your opinion, which one is more likely to happen: people greatly benefit from XR tech and manage to integrate it into a healthy life, or XR tech will facilitate people to close up within themselves and completely isolate themselves from real life? 

My feelings: This could be funny to see -

But hopefully happens only after I’m gone
